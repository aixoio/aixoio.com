title: "1 Project 4 Stacks"

Today I made the same project, a simple URL shrinker/shortener with 4
stacks for making a full stack web-app to find the one I enjoyed the
most when making.

First I made a basic URL shortener in my [perfect stack](/posts/my-current-stack-3-jul-2024), to get a feel
for the project, this a simple single page URL shortener that will use
a database, API and UI. Just like any full-stack web app. As normal I
found my stack to be easy and fast to code as normal.

Now, that I have a feel for the project I then made it with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/),
and from making it in Supabase I found that writing the code is
as easy and simple as it can be but setting up Supabase was
painful to do I found it hard to manage and I do not like how
anyone can just delete your hole app's database by default. I
will not be using Supabase again, or at least as a replacement
for my backend but maybe for some auth handling.

Next we are back to Go, but this time using it's built-in
HTML template engine to make our web-app. As normal I found
this easy to code but I did not like how getting Tailwind CSS
felt like a hacked together mess. So because of this I most
likely will not returning to this stack.

Time to adventure off to the land of JavaScript with the MEAN
stack except I have made a few changes but it's still very
similar to the original MEAN stack, first I switch Angular
for Vue because I don't want to learn Angular for a small
project like this, this I switched Node.js for [Deno](https://deno.com/) because I
want to use TypeScript. With this stack I felt that it was
easy to find a package for anything, however I will not be
using it again because I found it harder to Dockerize and
did not enjoy working with Deno.

Next is [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), I was not able to finish
this project in Nuxt because I don't want to learn it for this
but after giving it a try, I like it. I don't like Java/TypeScript
on the backend but I do like Nuxt.

After all, I will be staying with my current stack because I
could still make this app faster in it when compared to everything
else I tried today. I just don't see the point of learning any
thing new I tried today and I'm happy with my perfect stack. I did also
look at [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Spring](https://spring.io/) but I did not try them
because I could not see myself using them in projects to come.

Thanks for reading.
