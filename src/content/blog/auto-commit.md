Not that long ago I had the idea of "What if I use an LLM for generating Git commits?"
So like any normal person I made a new Go project that feeds the output of running `git status`
into the Ollama API with Meta Llama3 8b. Once the commit has been generated by program will
also add all files and commit it to Git. The original idea was for it to auto-run when you
save a file but then I wondered "How would you make a .env file without it being committed?"
If you want to see my terrible code it's on my GitHub and is called [auto-commit](https://github.com/aixoio/auto-commit).

Thanks for reading.
