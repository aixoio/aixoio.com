At the time of posting this my current full stack tech stack is

# Full-stack apps
This first stack is for building _fast_ full stack apps.

## Frontend

Here are the tools I use for Frontend devolvement

### **1.** [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

I use Vue because React is too big is verbose

### **2.** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

I use Tailwind CSS and SCSS because I will go crazy if I have to code CSS

### **3.** [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)

Justs makes JavaScript feel less like JavaScript

### **4.** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

I need **<u>TYPES</u>**!

### **5.** [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)

Pinia state management for Vue.

### **6.** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

Vite because it works great with Vue

### **7.** [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

I dislike React, so I am not going to use React Native, and I like Flutter
because it's easy to use

## Backend

Here are the tools I use for making my backend APIs

### **1.** [Go](https://go.dev/)

I use Go/lang because I have never found something easier to use
also because I am sick of writing Java.

### **2.** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

A while ago I used MySQL because I like SQL then I tried SQLite
but stopped using it because I had never used MongoDB and wanted
to try it and then I stopped switching thanks to PostgreSQL because
it has the best of all other databases.

### **3.** [GORM](https://gorm.io/)

I am sick of writing SQL, making vulnable apps, and I find the Go
standard libary for SQL to not be the best I have heard about sqlx
but have not tried it yet.

### **4.** [Redis](https://redis.io/)

I use Redis as a cache layer because it is a _fast_ database.

### **5.** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

I don't want to say "But it works on my machine"

### **6.** [Nginx](https://nginx.org/)

I use Nginx as a reverse-proxy to my apps Docker container

### **7.** [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/)

I use Apache HTTP Server to server the web frontend. Yes, I do
route Apache HTTP Server behind Nginx.

### **8.** [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/)

Go Echo/Echo is a Go web framework that I find easy to write
and gives good performance in production.

### **9.** [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)

Live reload is very nice

# Blogs/Documentation

Here are the tools I use to make blogs/documentation like this one!

## Astro

Just Astro and sometimes Tailwind CSS because I want fast
page load times.

# Sometime soon

Sometime soon I would like to give [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) a try,
I have also been looking at the Go HTML template engine becauseI think it
would work well with HTMX and Alpine, not too mention I want to try
[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) because I want to deploy a bit faster

Thanks for reading!
