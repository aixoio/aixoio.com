Hi everyone,

I have not posted in a while but I am starting to work on a game,
it's a 3D fast paced racing game that can go on forever with generated levels,
because of this I leant Blender so that I can make the models and now I am starting
to learn the game engine that I will use for this project. In the past I would have used
Go and I wanted to but there is no good option for a 3D game engine for Go, then there is
Unity and Unreal. I dislike both because they are not open-source and free forever, so they
only leaves Godot. The game engine I will be using to make my game. I will keep you updated with
my game's progress and all code for it will be open-source and free under a FOSS license. Right now
I am still learning the ins and outs of Godot and Blender.

Todays post was a short one, I will try to keep you updated. Thanks for readding.
