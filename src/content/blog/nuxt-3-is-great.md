title: "Nuxt 3 is great!"

I wanted to make websites and web apps faster
so I took the time to learn Nuxt 3. It is the
best framework I have ever used. I can built
apps faster then ever before. Deploy for free
with Netlify, and add styles with Tailwind CSS.

Now for building full-stack websites/web-apps I
will use Nuxt 3, Vue 3, Pinia, Tailwind CSS, Dasiy
UI, Drizzle ORM or Mongoose and MongoDB or MySQL or
PostgreSQL or libSQL with Turso, and I can deploy
all of that to Netlify or Vercel for free.
