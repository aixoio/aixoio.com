In the past I **only** used MySQL but I have started to try PostgreSQL,
and SQLite. The more I use SQL databases I see that they don't fit every
app the same. Sometimes it will be a match made in heaven, other times
it feels like your fighting the database, this is when you should use
MongoDB. I will use MongoDB when I feel like I am fighting with SQL,
just to make my schema.
